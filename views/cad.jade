      | During my sophomore year I had the fantastic opportunity to travel to Botswana with MIT's D-Lab. The running joke within my group was that I would ride an elephantâ€”the joke being that while people ride Asian elephants, African elephants are more notorious for killing people and such. After the trip, I made this elephant as a present for my trip leader. The gift itself was this model, split into horizontal layers with Rhino's contour command and lasercut out of MDF.
