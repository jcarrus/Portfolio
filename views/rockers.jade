      | Interfacing with nearly every suspension component on the car, the rockers provide a great excuse to get familiar with sketch blocks, derived parts, and design tables. With so many clearance cphecks, subassemblies, and complex machining fixtures, rocker design has the potential to be very time consuming. By restructuring this part to be entirely driven by a master sketch, Solidworks manages updates, and designs can be iterated quickly. This structure was invaluable during last minute packaging changes and suspension updates.

      | The anti-roll bar presents an interesting design problem. As one of the only components on the car designed to significantly bend, the stiffness calculations were involved. Solidworks Simulation provided good starting estimates, but it was important to consider potential non-linearities in the sway plate's adjustibility. This was a great opportunity to dig deep into Solidworks Simulation.

      | Machining both the rockers and anti-roll bar sway plate were a lot of fun with our new CNC equipment. The rockers were waterjet to a rough outline and then held in softjaws for the HASS Super Mini for the milling operations. The ARB was turned on a CNC ProtoTrack lathe and then finished on a HASS VF-2 using a set of square collet blocks.
