      | The process of validation and optimization is powered by information, and the tuning of a Formula SAE race car is no different. To better understand our car's behavior during testing, the team needed real-time data. The goal of the project was to develop an architecture for data acquisition that could be retrofit into previous as well as integrated into future vehicles.
    p
      | I developed a system with three main components: an array of arduino-controlled sensors, a modified xBee Pro radio module, and a cross-platform Chrome Application to collect data and display it in real time. Information flows from both the sensors—thermocouples, accelerometers, a GPS to name a few—and the car's internal monitoring systems—embedded thermistors, driver inputs, and battery monitoring systems—to the arduino. The information then is transmitted using xBee's RF protocol to a laptop running the Chrome App to display the data in real time and log the data for later analysis.
    p
      | A proof-of-concept system, developed over a week in the fall semester, worked effectively during the fall testing period, proving that the system provides a robust solution to data acquisition. In the spring, the proof-of-concept proto-board system is making the transition to a PCB with a waterproof enclosure and the Chrome App is getting data visualization with D3.js and a server backend to manage all testing data.
