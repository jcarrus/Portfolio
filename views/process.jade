      | I've always been thoughtful about how I work. It's not enough to create an elegant solution if the process itself is not also elegant. I'm constantly searching for new approaches, methods, and tools to bring simplicity, repeatability, and transparency to the design process. This is a large part of who I am in the workplace, and I am looking for a group of people that share my desire to not only be thoughtful about design, but also

      | The collection of projects on this site are not exhaustive. Rather, they show how I've approached problems in the past, in various contexts. Never have I been asked to make something more transparent, repeatable, or simple, though this, I believe, has made all the difference.

      a(href='/daq') Data Acquisition
      |  has been a "to do" on the FSAE team for five years now. Always put off due to the complexity of the integration, I restarted the effort this year with simplicity in mind. Leveraging technologies that already existed, I added remote data logging to the car in less than one week. The arduino-based sensor box is familiar to mechanical and electrical engineers on the team, and working in the browser is nothing new to the computer science students. Most importantly, a working prototype stirred interest and continues to fuel the project today. The process was simple.

      | Last year in designing the 
      a(href='/rockers') FSAE Rockers and Anti-Roll Bars
      | , I drove every bit of modeling from a master sketch. The CAD, FEA, and CAM were all created as derived parts and assemblies. Even the master sketch itself was a derived part referencing the suspension points. A change anywhere in the design would immediately propagate. The only validation is to press run on the FEA and check the factor of safety. This year's rocker design took only 45 minutes to fix the suspension sketch reference and double check the FoS. The design process was repeatable.

      | Migrating the 
      a(href='/tracksim') Track Simulation
      |  from Excel to JavaScript saw a substantial performance increase, but more importantly, the transition increased the transparency of the tool with comments and descriptive variable names to guide future developers. While the Excel-based sim had been around for more than a decade, members of my group were discussing all of the new applications of a simulation they could use and modify. The process was transparent.

      | The pictured elephant was a gift for a mentor, modeled in Fusion360, a new CAD/CAM product from Autodesk. Intrigued by the sculpting tools, I gave the suite a try with this project. The gift itself was this model, split into horizontal layers and laser cut out of MDF.
