      | Technology is making cars smarterâ€”and roads safer. During my summer at Ford's Innovation Center in Palo Alto, I worked with another intern to explore the possibilites afforded by a sensor-connected bicycle. The result, the InfoCycle, is a small, fork-mounted sensor box that communicates via bluetooth with your mobile phone. An app displays data in real time and pushes your data to a central repository for big data analysis. This data could be used to inform drivers or cyclists of potential congestion, warn cyclists of harsh road conditions, and guide city planners to improve mobility within the city.

      | The final deliverable took the form of an array of off-the-shelf sensors packaged into a 3D printed enclosure. One guiding design requirement was that it be possible for the box to be constructed by anyone with basic soldering skills and a 3D printer. This led to a design that played to the strengths of rapid prototyping techniques in order to maintain robust performance while cycling.
